)
}
\arguments{
\item{vdjdb_human}{Preprocessed human VDJdb data (from preprocess_vdjdb_for_training)}

\item{vdjdb_mouse}{Preprocessed mouse VDJdb data (from preprocess_vdjdb_for_training)}

\item{iedb_curated}{Curated IEDB data (from curate_iedb_for_tcr_model), or NULL to skip}

\item{min_epitope_samples}{Minimum samples per epitope to include}
}
\value{
List with combined data and metadata (same structure as combine_datasets)
}
\description{
Integrates data from multiple sources, handles deduplication,
and returns a unified dataset compatible with the training pipeline.
