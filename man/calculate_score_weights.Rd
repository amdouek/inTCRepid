\title{Calculate sample weights based on VDJdb score}
\usage{
calculate_score_weights(scores, method = "exponential", min_weight = 0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{Numeric vector of VDJdb scores}

\item{method}{Weighting method: "linear", "exponential", "custom", "aggressive"}

\item{min_weight}{Minimum weight for score=0 entries}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of sample weights
}
\description{
Score interpretation:
0 = Low confidence (no validation) - weight lower but don't exclude
1 = Some evidence
2 = Good evidence
3 = High confidence (structural/multiple validation)
}
