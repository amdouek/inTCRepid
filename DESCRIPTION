Description: A deep learning framework for predicting epitope sequences from T-cell receptor (TCR) CDR3 sequences. Implements a dual-encoder architecture with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), attention-based pooling, and contrastive learning for TCR-epitope binding prediction. Supports transfer learning from large human datasets (VDJdb, IEDB) to smaller mouse datasets, with post-hoc temperature scaling for probability calibration.
